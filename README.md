# Summary #

Dish I.Q. is a web application aimed at connecting people to their favorite dishes while keeping their health and diet needs in mind.  You can search for a recipe and add additional parameters to meet you physiological needs.  Some of the parameters the user can take advantage of are: max calorie count, high-fiber, high-protein, peanut-free, shellfish-free, and many more.

The search results will provide a picture of the dish as well as all of the ingredients, all of the nutrional information of the dish, as well as a link on how to prepare the dish.

# UX #

Dish I.Q. is fully responsive and will adjust depending on the user's device.  Below are some images of the user flow and wireframes.
